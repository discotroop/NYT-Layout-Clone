# NYT-Layout-Clone
5.3.2020 

Clone of NYT layout for articles. HTML/CSS only, no JS.

This purpose of this project is to practice page, layout, markup and styling in html/css. 

I got this project for The Odin Projects HTML/CSS course.

You can view the page to clone here: https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/science/space/detection-of-waves-in-space-buttresses-landmark-theory-of-big-bang.html?_r=0

Lessons Learned:
- An ounce of planning is worth a pound of fixing.
- A standard style guide for CSS would be helpful.
- <ul>s are great for managing long lists of links.
  
 To Do:
 - Refactor and lint to make both HTML and CSS more readable and logical.
